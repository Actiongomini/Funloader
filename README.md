A little python program for running some itch.io games offline (as well as *cough* in schools *cough*)

games right now include: we need to talk, eaglercraft, quarantine, pico-dino and intertwine with more to come eventually. 

This is very much designed to be run on any system with python and a web browser, but if your *educational* facilities do not include python installed you can just open the folders up.

Almost everything was extracted from itch.io by moi, these are free anyway so like ehhh. But i did **not** make them.
